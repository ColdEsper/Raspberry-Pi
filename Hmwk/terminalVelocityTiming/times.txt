           On Raspberry
part    executable                time
2       cterminalVelocity         66  seconds
3       cscaledTerminalVelocity   78  seconds
4       cnewtonScaledVelocity     398 seconds
4       scaledPseudoAsm           784 seconds
5       newtonScaledVelocity      675 seconds
6       floatPseudoAsm            83  seconds
7       terminalVelocity          31  seconds

4 vs 6 was 398 seconds vs 83 seconds, so part 6 was over four times faster than part 4

5 vs 7 was 675 seconds vs 31 seconds, so part 7 was over twenty times faster than part 5
